// You are given the method swap which accepts two pointers and performs a swap between them.

// The method is invoked as follows:

// void* left = new int[0];
// void* right = new int[0];
// swap(left, right);
// After such execution, left should point to the previous address of right and vice versa.

// But... something is wrong! Can you fix the method so it will actually swap the pointers?



void swap(void* &left, void* &right) {
    void* temp = left;
    left = right;
    right = temp;
};
